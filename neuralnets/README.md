# neuralnets
This is where I keep my experimental code with machine learning with Roblox. I've noted my explanations and thought process in some of my experiments, just in case I can help anyone who finds this.

These are the libraries I use:
- Jobro13's Neuro ([Repo](https://github.com/jobro13/Neuro))
- Kironte's Neural Network Libraries ( [V1](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/400885) | [V2](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/869557) )
