--[[You only need to modify the modulescript
This is a module made to play continous playlist globally. Feel free to modify this to your own needs, including paid request systems, self-playing server module, client-only playlist, etc.

To use, simply fire the three remotes: PlayMusicRemote, StopMusicRemote, and RequestMusicRemote, passing the player and the playlist name in string. You can do this from a GUI admin panel, a console, a chat command, etc. For firing from GUIs, I suggest passing on the localplayer and button.Name.

    Hierarchy:
    ModuleScript
        >Server Script
        >GlobalMusicGUI - Or put this in StarterGui and delete the serverscript function at line 45-49
            >LocalScript
            >MuteButton (optional)
